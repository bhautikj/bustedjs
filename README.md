About
=====

This is a small personal project I use to learn some javascript/jquery/HTML5/CSS3
stuff. I have an interest in web development and hope to become more familiar with it.

Summary
=======
Here are some of the things I've worked with on this project:  
* jQuery/DOM manipulation
* AJAX
* CSS animations

TODO
====
Automatic refresh - remove button  
Style the predictions a little better  
Do something better than dropdowns
